## Working with me

With the mentality of absorbing and learning everything from all the situations present in my life, mainly in the
 professional scope, I try to develop myself through work experiences to improve my technical knowledge.

Not only of technical attributes are made a professional, but the ability to communicate, teamwork and strategic planning are the key to achieving goals accurately. Thus, I believe that every person regardless of its level of knowledge has something to teach us, and that interpersonal relationships contribute to the development of countless sectors of our lives.

Therefore, I believe that having contact with people it's a primordial step for thrive in your
career, creating this network of helping and being helped by others, will create a clear path for you.

Working in a team, even that I know how to do my job, I try to talk with each other of the team, to check
if they really understand what the current project/task is about, and if I can help in some point.
